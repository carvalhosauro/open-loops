# Changelog
## [Unreleased]

### Highlights
- `loops worktrees` (alias `wt`) — lists every git worktree across configured roots with a cleanup verdict (`deletable`, `cold`, `active`, `prunable`, `home`); prints exact cleanup commands, never deletes anything.
- `loops completions <shell>` — prints shell completion scripts for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, and others.
- All CLI output, error messages, comments, test names, and user docs migrated to English.
